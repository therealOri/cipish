# cipish
A little script I use to interact with the Ciphey docker container.


# Info
What this script does is check to see if docker is running. If it is then it will ask you for a command (one that works with [Ciphey](https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey).)
If docker is not running, It will start docker and then do the same.
